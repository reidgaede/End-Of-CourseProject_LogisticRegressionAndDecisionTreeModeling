# End-Of-CourseProject_LogisticRegressionAndDecisionTreeModeling
Using Jupyter, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn to explore, visualize, and ultimately model upon real-world data to predict course passage/failure for students in a Portuguese class.

## Background
The files contained in this repository (with the exception of "README.md") constitute my submission for the final project for [Data Preparation, Modeling and Visualization with Python](https://cpe.ucdavis.edu/section/data-preparation-modeling-and-visualization-python-0), the final of five courses required for completion of the [Python for Data Science, Web and Core Programming Professional Concentration](https://cpe.ucdavis.edu/certificate-program/python-data-science-web-and-core-programming-professional-concentration) offered by the Continuing and Professional Education division of the University of California, Davis.
My submission received a perfect score.

Project directions that guided creation of "Week7Project_Final.ipynb" can be found at the very beginning of said Jupyter Notebook. Dataset information for "student-por.csv" can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository's website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).

## System Requirements and Recommendations
Download and set-up of the (free) [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), which should contain the latest versions of pandas, NumPy, Jupyter, etc., is recommended prior to accessing "Week7Project_Final.ipynb". Once download and set-up are complete, simply open Anaconda Navigator and click "Launch" within the dashboard tile containing the "Jupyter" logo. Upon clicking "Launch" a new tab should open in your browser window. It is within this tab that you should navigate to "Week7Project_Final.ipynb" within the "End-Of-CourseProject_LogisticRegressionAndDecisionTreeModeling" directory/repository.

Once this repository is downloaded to one's personal machine, it is recommended that both "Week7Project_Final.ipynb" and "student-por.csv" - the input dataset for "Week7Project_Final.ipynb" - be kept in-repository so that users need not concern themselves with manually re-declaring the filepath to "student-por.csv" within "Week7Project_Final.ipynb".
